# Sorting Algorithms

In preparation for my algorithms class Spring '22, I went to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) and went down the list seeing if I could build the algorithms by their descriptions. I used loops and pythonic statements for the element switches, but intentionally left out built-ins like `min()`, `max()`, etc. I am pretty sure they are correctly constructed.
