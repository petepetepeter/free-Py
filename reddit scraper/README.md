# Python I Final project
This was a final assignment I created in November of 2020. There is probably a lot of "worst practices" at play becuase I had only been coding between my studies for 3 months when I started this.

I will eventually spend the time to detail and comment about what parts do what. Hope the functionality presents itself to those who actually know how to code!
